# A Simple Shell

## Description
This program provides basic and some brand-new shell function, just like pipe, basic redirection, and so on.What's more, I reconstruct the C code architecture, making it be clean code.

## Usage

```bash
make
cd test
sh demo.sh
```

## Warning
If progarm cannot execute the binary file, please use

```bash
cd bin
chmod +x * 
```
to add the executable permission.
